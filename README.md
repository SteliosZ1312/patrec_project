# Project Title: Results Reproduction and Extension for Union of Manifolds Hypothesis

## Introduction

This project is part of our 9th-semester course on Pattern Recognition at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). We have based our work on the projects available at [layer6ai-labs/UoMH](https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/UoMH) and [ppope/dimensions](https://github.com/ppope/dimensions). Our goal is to reproduce the results from the original UoMH project and extend its capabilities to include the audio modality.

## Original Repository

The initial work for this project was obtained from the following repositories:

[https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/UoMH](https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/UoMH)

## Project Objectives

1. **Results Reproduction:**
   - Our primary objective is to reproduce the results obtained in the original project to validate and verify its findings.

2. **Extension to Other Modalities:**
   - In addition to image-based modalities, we aim to extend the project's capabilities to include the audio modality. This involves incorporating the audio-mnist dataset and algorithms from the [[ppope/dimensions](https://github.com/ppope/dimensions)](https://github.com/ppope/dimensions) repo.

## Usage

Please refer to the documentation provided in the original repository for details on how to run and use the code.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the authors of [layer6ai-labs/UoMH](https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/UoMH) and [ppope/dimensions](https://github.com/ppope/dimensions) for their valuable contributions.
