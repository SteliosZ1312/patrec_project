# Project Title: Results Reproduction and Extension for Union of Manifolds Hypothesis

## Introduction

This project is part of our 9th-semester course on Pattern Recognition at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). We have based our work on the project available at [layer6ai-labs/UoMH](https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/UoMH). Our goal is to reproduce the results from the original project and extend its capabilities to include more modalities other than images.

## Original Repository

The initial work for this project was obtained from the following repository:

[https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/UoMH](https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/UoMH)

## Project Objectives

1. **Results Reproduction:**
   - Our primary objective is to reproduce the results obtained in the original project to validate and verify its findings.

2. **Extension to Other Modalities:**
   - In addition to image-based modalities, we aim to extend the project's capabilities to include other modalities. This involves incorporating new datasets and algorithms.

## Usage

Please refer to the documentation provided in the original repository for details on how to run and use the code.
